Project Artemere - Tech Road Map
"To interpret good art, and output great art."
Project Details - How the Product Works
Take two images and create a token that is a 1-to-1 mapping with the processed image.
Users can create new and trade existing tokens to collect cool images.
	Step 1) Upload images	
		Input/Output
		Technologies?
		Implementation?
Step 2) Merge images - But cool
Step 3) Hash image
	Hamming distance to remove duplicate seeds
Step 4) Convert hash to image
Step 5) Create Marketplace
Input: Local image upload
Black box: Off-chain image correction or image combination
How to hash image and recreate image from hash (talk to Corey more look into p-hashing or fuzzy hashing | what exactly are the restrictions on the hash?
limitations of storing data on ethereum - 
maybe there's some way you can have 10 different tokens represent one image

Output: Hash of output image associated with ethereum address 
Process: Upload two images and the goal is to perform a 50% random pixel swap using OpenCV and then take that output image and convert to a phash which is then the seed of the ERC-721 token hash. ERC-721 token hash can be
